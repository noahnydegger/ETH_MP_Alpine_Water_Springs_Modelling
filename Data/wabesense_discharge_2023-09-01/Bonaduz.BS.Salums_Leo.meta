# Each dictionary must contain the **start**, **end**, and **description** fields.
# Where **start** and **end** are timedates, and **description** is a free text explanation
# of the interval, e.g. why the data is invalid.

# An optional field **time-zone** can be given on each dictionary to indicate the
# time-zone of that interval. If not given, the interval is interpreted as UTC.
